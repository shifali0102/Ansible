There are two types of machines when we talk about deployment −
1.Control machine − Machine from where we can manage other machines.
2.Remote machine − Machines which are handled/controlled by control machine.

There can be multiple remote machines which are handled by one control machine. 
So, for managing remote machines we have to install Ansible on control machine.
1.Control Machine Requirements:
Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (versions 2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed.
Windows does not support control machine.
By default, Ansible uses ssh to manage remote machine.
