There are two types of machines when we talk about deployment −
1.Control machine − Machine from where we can manage other machines.
2.Remote machine − Machines which are handled/controlled by control machine.

There can be multiple remote machines which are handled by one control machine. 
So, for managing remote machines we have to install Ansible on control machine.
1.Control Machine Requirements:
Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (versions 2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed.
Windows does not support control machine.
By default, Ansible uses ssh to manage remote machine.

--> sudo apt-get update
--> sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
--> sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
--> sudo apt-get update 
--> sudo apt-get install ansible
--> ansible --version

Installed ansible on JenkinsNew (CONTROL MACHINE).
node is Shifalivm

 SSH CONNECTION : BETWEEN MASTER/HOST AND NODES 
 ===============

 In Master :
 Run the commands 
 1)ssh-keygen
 2)cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 (copy the key )
 
 IN SLAVE :
1)cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
paste the key here 

Now run "SSH slave ip address(eg:ubuntu@172.5.6.7)" in Master
this will let u login directly without the password.
exit -->to logout from slave

when we will exit out of this slave/node we will enter the master
