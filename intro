Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and
many other IT tools.
you can create VM --> environment provisioning
you can install things on top of it --> configuration
u can also deploy --> deployment

Ansible is not a part of CICD generally it is instead for environment provisioning and then creating ur pipeline.
But if deployment is involved u can use it in ur pipeline.

Ansible uses playbook to describe automation jobs, and playbook uses very simple language i.e. YAML .

Ansible is designed for multi-tier deployment. Ansible does not manage one system at time, it models IT infrastructure
by describing all of your systems are interrelated.

After connecting to your nodes, Ansible pushes small programs called as “Ansible MODULES”. 
Ansible runs that modules on your nodes and removes them when finished. 

Ansible manages your inventory in simple text files (These are the hosts file). Ansible uses the hosts file where one can group the hosts and can control 
the actions on a specific group in the playbooks.
