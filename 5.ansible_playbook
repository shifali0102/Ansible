ansible-playbook is used for configuration management and deployment.
Playbooks are the files where Ansible code is written. Playbooks are written in YAML format. 
YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language. Playbooks are one of the core features of Ansible and tell Ansible what to execute. 
They are like a to-do list for Ansible that contains a list of tasks.

Playbooks contain the steps which the user wants to execute on a particular machine. Playbooks are run sequentially. 
Playbooks are the building blocks for all the use cases of Ansible.

Playbook Structure
Each playbook is an aggregation of one or more plays in it. Playbooks are structured using Plays. 
There can be more than one play inside a playbook.
The function of a play is to map a set of instructions defined against a particular host.

--- 
   name: install and configure DB
   hosts: testServer
   become: yes

   vars: 
      oracle_db_port_value : 1521
   
   tasks:
   -name: Install the Oracle DB
      yum: <code to install the DB>
    
   -name: Ensure the installed service is enabled and running
   service:
      name: <your service name>
****executable playbook 

- hosts: web
  tasks:
  - name: ansible create directory example
    file:
      path: /tmp/devops_directory
      state: directory
      
 --> ansible-playbook play1.yaml
 
      
  The Different YAML Tags
1.  name: Any logical name can be given to the playbook.
2. hosts: It tells Ansible on which hosts to run the listed tasks.
One can run the tasks on multiple machines and hence hosts tag can have a group of hostsâ€™ entry as well.
3. vars: Vars tag lets you define the variables which you can use in your playbook. Usage is similar to variables in any programming language.
4. tasks: Tasks are a list of actions one needs to perform.Each task internally links to a piece of code called a module. 
A module that should be executed, and arguments that are required for the module you want to execute.
