Ad hoc commands are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions. These commands need not be performed later.
For example, you have to reboot all your company servers. For this, you will run the Adhoc commands from ‘/usr/bin/ansible’.
These ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration management and deployment, because these commands are of one time usage.
